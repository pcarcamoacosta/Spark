    "According to a 2010 report made by the US Federal Aviation Administration, the economic price of domestic flight delays entails a yearly cost of 32.9 billion dollars to passengers, airlines and other parts of the economy. More than half of that amount comes from passengers' pockets, as they do not only waste time waiting for their planes to leave, but also miss connecting flights, spend money on food and have to sleep on hotel rooms while they're stranded.\n",
    "\n",
    "The report, focusing on data from year 2007, estimated that air transportation delays put a 4 billion dollar dent in the country's gross domestic product that year. Full report can be found \n",

    "\n",
    "But which are the causes for these delays?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer this question, we are going to analyze the provided dataset, containing up to 1.936.758 different internal flights in the US for 2008 and their causes for delay, diversion and cancellation; if any.\n",

    "When initially downloading the December 2007 an comparing it with the January 2008 fligths dataset we previously worked with in class, we uncovered that there was a significant imbalance of the datasets. The January dataset only had 100,000 observations in comparison to 616,000 observations of the December 2007 dataset. Hence, we opted to download both datasets for December 2007 and January 2008 to complete our analysis.  The following are the features contained in our datasets:\n",

    "1. **YEAR** 2007, 2008\n",
    "2. **MONTH** 12, 1\n",
    "3. **DAY_OF_MONTH** 1-31\n",
    "4. **DAY_OF_WEEK** 1 (Monday) - 7 (Sunday)\n",
    "5. **ORIGIN** origin IATA airport code\n",
    "6. **DEST** destination IATA airport code\n",
    "7. **DEP_DELAY** departure delay, in minutes\n",
    "8. **DEP_DELAY_NEW** departure delay, in minutes\n",
    "9. **DEP_DEL15** boolean representing 1 if departing flight was delayed over 15 minutes and 0 if it was not\n",
    "10. **ARR_DELAY** arrival delay, in minutes: A flight is counted as \"on time\" if it operated less than 15 minutes later the scheduled time shown \n",
    "11. **ARR_DEL15** boolean representing 1 if arriving flight was delayed over 15 minutes and 0 if it was not \n",
    "12. **CANCELLED** *was the flight cancelled\n",
    "13. **CANCELLATION_CODE** reason for cancellation (A = carrier, B = weather, C = NAS, D = security)\n",
    "14. **DIVERTED** 1 = yes, 0 = no\n",
    "15. **CARRIER_DELAY** in minutes: Carrier delay is within the control of the air carrier. Examples of occurrences that may determine carrier delay are: aircraft cleaning, aircraft damage, awaiting the arrival of connecting passengers or crew, baggage, bird strike, cargo loading, catering, computer, outage-carrier equipment, crew legality (pilot or attendant rest), damage by hazardous goods, engineering inspection, fueling, handling disabled passengers, late crew, lavatory servicing, maintenance, oversales, potable water servicing, removal of unruly passenger, slow boarding or seating, stowing carry-on baggage, weight and balance delays.\n",
    "16. **WEATHER_DELAY** in minutes: Weather delay is caused by extreme or hazardous weather conditions that are forecasted or manifest themselves on point of departure, enroute, or on point of arrival.\n",
    "17. **NAS_DELAY** in minutes: Delay that is within the control of the National Airspace System (NAS) may include: non-extreme weather conditions, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, air traffic control, etc.\n",
    "18. **SECURITY_DELAY** in minutes: Security delay is caused by evacuation of a terminal or concourse, re-boarding of aircraft because of security breach, inoperative screening equipment and/or long lines in excess of 29 minutes at screening areas.\n",
    "19. **LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY** in minutes: Arrival delay at an airport due to the late arrival of the same aircraft at a previous airport. The ripple effect of an earlier delay at downstream airports is referred to as delay propagation\n",

SEA and LAX had a total of 2,211 and 4,111 delays attributed to NAS_DELAYS respectively. However, NAS_DELAY only accounts for an aggregate of minute delays of 42,881 and 90,474 respectively, second to LATE_AIRCRAFT_ARRIVAL_DELAY with aggregate minute delays of 63,177 and 141,065.

In contrast, December 24 and December 31 had flight arrival delays representing between 1% and 2% of total arrival delays for that month.

We can also determine that the reason that generated the longest delays on these important holidays in term of minutes was LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY for all airports except for SEA on Christmas Eve and LAX on New Year's Eve, whose longest delay in minutes was due to NAS_DELAY.

    "When examining our analysis of arrival and departure differences between December 2007 and January 2008, we find a large difference in overall flight volume between both months. In particular, when looking at arrival delays and departure delays, we can clearly see a spike in number and percentages of delays due to the increase in the number of travelers passing through our airports during the holiday season. It is also important to note that, while LAX sees more flights than the other 3 airports in out analysis, JFK experiences the highest percentage change in general travel patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key insights that we take from this analysis is that the busiest travel dates are not the major holidays: Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. The highest volume of inbound and outbound flights occurs in the days preceeding these holidays, between December 18 - 22. Another important consideration is that January 2008, which in our analysis serves as our baseline month for comparing December 2007, also experiences an inflated number of travelers returning home after the holidays in the first days of the month.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we examine the difference between December 24 and 31 and the average of Mondays in January 2008, we find minimal differences in arrivals, arrival delays, and departures. LAX is the airport with highest average difference between the two periods, with 607 arrivals in average for December 24 and December 31 against 622 average arrivals on Mondays in January 2008. The reported average departures for LAX during the same period is 1,221 and 619, showing that December 24 and 31 had double the average volume of flights departing when compared to the average of Monday flights in January 2008. On average, departure delays were also significant for LAX with an average of 273 delays for December 24 and 31 against and average of 162 for Mondays in January 2008. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we examine the difference one day later, between December 25 and January 1 and the average of Tuesdays in January 2008, we also find minimal differences in average arrivals, arrival delays, departures and departure delays. While LAX shows minimal differeces in average arrivals and arrival delays for the two periods in study, it shows higher average departures in December 25 and January 1 (635) against Tuesdays in January (618).  \n",
    "\n",
    "When we examine the reasons for flight delays we found that, in general there are more delays and longer delays in minutes for both arrivals and departures in December 2007 than in January 2008. While the overwhelming reason for long delay in minutes in our analysis is LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY, we find that NAS_DELAY is a pressing reason as far as number of delays for many airports and dates in our analysis, but usually NAS_DELAYS are shorter in duration than LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY.
